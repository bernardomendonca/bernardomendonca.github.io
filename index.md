Heya, Bernardo here!

I'm a PhD candidate and research at [ISF](https://www.uts.edu.au/isf).

I'm passionate about data science and I'm currently working on sustainable battery supply chains.

[Here](https://bernardomendonca.com/projects.html) you can find a non-exhaustive list of some of the projects I've been involved in the past. And over [here](https://bernardomendonca.com/archive.html) is where I might share some of my ideas as blog posts.
